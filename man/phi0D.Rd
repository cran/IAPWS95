\title{First Derivative of the Ideal-Gas part of the Dimensionless Helmholtz Energy
     Equation with respect to Density, Function of Density}
\usage{
phi0D(D, digits = 9)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{Density [ kg m-3 ]}

\item{digits}{Digits of results (optional)}
}
\value{
The First D Derivative of Ideal-gas part of the Helmholtz Energy: phi0D and an Error
     Message (if an error occur: \link{errorCodes})
}
\description{
The function \code{phi0D(D,digits=9)} returns the First Derivative of the
    Ideal-gas part of the dimensionless Helmholtz Energy Equation for a given D [kg/m3].
}
\details{
This function calls a Fortran DLL that solves the Helmholtz Energy Equation. 
    in accordance with the Revised Release on the IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the 
    Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific
    Use (June 2014) developed by the International Association for the Properties of
    Water and Steam,  \url{http://www.iapws.org/relguide/IAPWS-95.html}. It is valid  
    from the triple point to the pressure of 1000 MPa and temperature of 1273.
